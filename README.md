# Icosahedron-Java
Icosahedron Project Java 
Write a program that is composed of several classes: 
(1)Icosahedron, which defines Icosahedron objects by label, color and edge. Gives user ability to get and set label, color and edge. Calculates surface area, volume and surface area / volume ratio. Posses ability to check if a given Icosahedron is the same as another. Prints information detailing everything stated above.
(2)IcosahedronApp, which is a driver that reads in data from user input, creates an Icosahedron object and prints the object. 
(3)IcosahedronList2, which stores the name of a list, an array of Icosahedronobjects, and number of objects in that array. Calculates total surface area and volume along with average surface area, volume and surface area / volume ratio of all objects in the Icosahedron array.Is able to read a file that contains Icosahedron objects. Has add, edit, delete and find properties to manipulate the array of Icosahedrons. Prints information detailed in Icosahedron along with a summary that shows total and average calculations.
(4)IcosahedronList2MenuApp, which is a driver class for IcosahedronList2 that presents the user with a menu of 8 options. These options allow the user the ability to choose what they want to do IcosahedronList2 instance. Read file, print info, print summary, add, delete, edit, find and quit the app are the options.
